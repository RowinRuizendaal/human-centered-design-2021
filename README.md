I worked together with Marijn, Marijn has no fine motor skills and experiences planning his trip as an extra burden, it is up to me to take his burden off him.

### Problem

The current problem for Marijn is that the current [NS](https://ns.nl) is currently a burden for Marijn, everytime he want's to plan a train trip a has to fill in forms, filling in these forms on the website is something that Marijn can't do within seconds it takes him a extra longer time.

The task for me is to make a application where Marijn can plan a trip within just a few click.


### User scenario

#### Who is Marijn?

Marijn is a 44 year old man who lives with hes 2 childeren and wife, Marijn is a technical chief architect. He ensures that all metadata for almost all music in the world is correct. Marijn is a 'nerd' as he calls himself like that, also Marijn hates using the tab key and is using all the VIM shortcuts



### How can this be achieved?

Stripping of the NS website can be a lot better for Marijn, taking things out that takes him longer then the usual person, that is why I am trying to take the steps out that takes Marijn extra of time.
